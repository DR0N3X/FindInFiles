# FindInFiles

I couldn't find any simple tool for searching files containing given text..<br>
(Notepad++ crashed with blue screen, VisualStudio is too much, Googling didn't return any simple free tools, Atom is too slow to start, Windows content: search is super slow..etc), so had to make one :/<br>
<br>
Still work-in-progress (but usable already)
